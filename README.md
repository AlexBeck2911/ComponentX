# ComponentX

ComponentX is a versatile library that aims to simplify 
the development process by providing a unified solution for 
creating components across multiple projects and frameworks. 
With ComponentX, you no longer have to repeat the same work 
for each project and framework, saving you time and effort.

# Overview
ComponentX is built with [Mitosis](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis) 
and therefore providing a framework-independent 
solution. It allows you to create reusable components that can be 
easily integrated into various frontend frameworks, 
including Vue, React, and Angular.

# Installation
To use ComponentX in your project, you can install it via npm:

#### `npm install componentx`

# Getting started
To start using the reusable components please check out our
list of components. There you'll receive an explanation on
how to use that component in your desired framework.
